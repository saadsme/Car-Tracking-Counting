# Car-Tracking-Counting
Counting the number of vehicles passing on a road. Built using YOLO and OpenCV in Python.
- The project is a computer vision system that uses OpenCV and YOLO (You Only Look Once) to count the number of vehicles passing on a road.
- The system was developed using Python and the OpenCV and YOLO libraries, which provide image processing and object detection capabilities.
- The system is designed to analyze video footage of a road, identify vehicles in the frame, and increment a count for each vehicle that passes by.
- The system can provide real-time counts as the video is being captured, or it can analyze recorded footage and produce a count after the fact. The results can be displayed on the screen or saved to a file for later analysis.
